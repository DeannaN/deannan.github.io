<a id="welcome-to-Dancing-With-Deanna" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-dancing-with-deanna" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Dancing With Deanna!</h3>

<p>Dancing With Deanna offers country western line dancing instruction for both beginners and experienced dancers alike, and every class can be customized to an appropriate level for audiences from children to seniors. Country line dancing with a group instructor is a great way to get your crowd onto the dance floor at birthday or anniversary parties or any event where country music will be played. Country line dancing requires no partners, so you can get dancers with unwilling spouses/dates out of their seats.</p>

<p>Instruction can be provided for groups as a block of multiple classes or single events such as parties. Dancing With Deanna primarily focuses on Suffolk County Long Island, but can provide instruction in neighboring areas based on availability.</p>

<a id="About-Deanna" class="anchor" href="#About-Deanna" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Deanna</h3>

<p>Deanna has been a dancer all of her life with a background in jazz, ballet, modern, lyrical, jitterbug, ballroom and country line dancing. She was born and raised on Long Island, and after earning her degree in communication from <a href="http://www.lasalle.edu">La Salle University</a> in Philadelphia she began instructing country line and ballroom classes in the Philadelphia suburbs while being mentored by Carolyn Rollin of Carolyn and Company Dance Productions. Deanna later performed as an apprentice with the <a href="http://www.contempradance.com/theatre/index.html">ContempraDANCE Theatre Company</a> in Wayne, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p></p>After moving back to her hometown on the North Shore of Long Island a few years ago, some local friends requested Deanna teach a country line dancing class so they could give it a try before heading out in public to dance. Soon Deanna began teaching again at both public community classes and private events, building the confidence of her students and providing a good time for all.</p> 

<p>Hope to see you on the dance floor!</p>
